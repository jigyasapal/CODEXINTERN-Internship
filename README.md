1. Iris Flower Classification
Objective: Classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on
measurements of their petals and sepals.

Dataset: The classic Iris dataset from UCI Repository or scikit-learn.
Steps:
o Load the dataset and explore it visually (scatter plots or histograms).
o Split the data into training/test sets.
o Preprocess if needed (usually, it's already clean).
o Train a simple classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision
Tree).
o Evaluate with accuracy, precision, or confusion matrix.
 Skills gained: Numeric data analysis, classification modeling, evaluating results.

 
2. Spam Mail Detector
Objective: Build a classifier that distinguishes between spam and non-spam (ham) emails
using textual data.

Dataset: Public datasets like the SMS Spam Collection (UCI) or Enron Email Dataset.
Steps:
o Load the messages and labels (spam or ham).
o Preprocess the text (lowercasing, remove stopwords, tokenization).
o Convert text into numeric features (Bag of Words or TF-IDF).
o Split into train/test sets.
o Train a simple model (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression).
o Measure performance with accuracy, precision, or F1 score.
Skills gained: Text preprocessing, feature extraction, basic NLP, classification.
